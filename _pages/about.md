Hello! I am a Postdoctoral Research Assistant in Solar Activity Reconstructions in the [Department of Meteorology, Universiy of Reading](https://research.reading.ac.uk/meteorology/) and a member of the [Space and Atmospheric Electricity Group (SPATE)](https://research.reading.ac.uk/met-spate/). 

I submitted my PhD thesis recently from the [Center of Excellence in Space Sciences India](www.cessi.in), [Indian Institute of Science Education and Research Kolkata.](https://www.iiserkol.ac.in/) where I worked with [Prof. Dibyendu Nandi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dibyendu_Nandi). My primary research interest is to explore long-term solar magnetic activity with the aid of magnetohydrodynamic simulations and statistical data analysis techniques.

I obtained a Master of Science degree in Physics in 2020 from the [Department of Physics, Institute of Science, Banaras Hindu University](https://www.bhu.ac.in/site/UnitHomeTemplate/1_147_1103_Institute-of-Science-Home), and a Bachelor of Science degree in Physics in 2018 from the [Ramakrishna Mission Residential College (Autonomous), Narendrapur.](https://rkmrc.in/)
