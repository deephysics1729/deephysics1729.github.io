Hi! I am Chitradeep, a final year PhD student at the [Center of Excellence in Space Sciences India](www.cessi.in), [Indian Institute of Science Education and Research Kolkata.](https://www.iiserkol.ac.in/) where I am working with [Prof. Dibyendu Nandi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dibyendu_Nandi). Primarily, I am studying long-term solar magnetic activity with the aid of magnetohydrodynamic simulations and statistical data analysis techniques.

I obtained a Master of Science degree in Physics in 2020 from the [Department of Physics, Institute of Science, Banaras Hindu University](https://www.bhu.ac.in/site/UnitHomeTemplate/1_147_1103_Institute-of-Science-Home), and a Bachelor of Science degree in Physics in 2018 from the [Ramakrishna Mission Residential College (Autonomous), Narendrapur.](https://rkmrc.in/)
