Sunspots have been observed for over four centuries and the magnetic nature of sunspot cycles has been known for about a century: however, some of its underlying physics still remain elusive. It is known that the solar magnetic cycle involves a recycling of magnetic flux between the poloidal and toroidal components of the magnetic field, that manifests as the solar dipole and sunspots, respectively. Here we report the discovery of a new relationship between the rise rate of the sunspot cycle and the decay rate of the solar (axial) dipole moment. We argue that this points to the existence of a causal connection between the aforementioned physical quantities -- providing an extension to the Waldmeier effect: namely, the decay rate of the Sun's dipole moment is related to the rate of rise and eventual amplitude of the following sunspot cycle. We demonstrate how one may take advantage of this new relationship to predict the amplitude and timing of the sunspot cycle. Our analysis indicates solar cycle 25 is going to be a weak-moderate cycle, peaking in \(2024.00_{-0.49}^{+0.68} \).
